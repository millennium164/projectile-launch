# projectile-launch
Based on the situation of an oblique projectile launch, using the equations of motion for both x and y axes, it's possible to calculate some values. On the x axis, the projectile describes a uniform motion, whereas on the y axis the projectile describes a uinformly accelerated motion.
Given the initial velocity magnitude and the angle of launch, we can output the maximum horizontal range and maximum height of the projectile. Also, it's possible to calculate the projectile position at any point in time, which allows the plotting of a position versus time graph.
